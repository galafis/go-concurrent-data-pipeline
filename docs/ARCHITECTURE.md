# Architecture Documentation

## Overview

This Go Concurrent Data Pipeline is designed to demonstrate best practices for building high-performance, concurrent data processing systems using Go's native concurrency primitives.

## System Architecture

### Pipeline Stages

The pipeline consists of the following stages, executed concurrently:

1. **Producer** - Generates or ingests data records
2. **Validator** - Validates data integrity and business rules
3. **Transformer** - Applies business logic and transformations
4. **Loader** - Persists processed data
5. **Error Handler** - Manages failed records
6. **Metrics Collector** - Aggregates performance metrics

### Concurrency Model

The system uses a **fan-out/fan-in** pattern with multiple workers:

```
Producer (1)
    ↓
Validators (N workers)
    ↓
Transformers (N workers)
    ↓
Fan-out ────┬─→ Loader (1)
            ├─→ Error Handler (1)
            └─→ Metrics Collector (1)
```

### Communication

All stages communicate via **buffered channels**:
- `dataCh`: Raw data from Producer to Validators
- `validCh`: Valid records from Validators to Transformers
- `processedCh`: Transformed records to fan-out stage
- `errorCh`: Error records to fan-out stage
- Individual channels for each consumer (Loader, ErrorHandler, MetricsCollector)

### Error Handling Strategy

The pipeline implements a **resilient error handling** approach:

1. **Validation Errors**: Records that fail validation are routed to the error channel
2. **Transformation Errors**: Records that fail transformation are routed to the error channel
3. **Error Persistence**: All failed records are logged with error details
4. **Non-blocking**: Errors do not stop the pipeline from processing valid records

### Scalability

The pipeline is **horizontally scalable**:
- Increase `numWorkers` to add more Validator and Transformer goroutines
- Each worker operates independently on different records
- No shared state between workers (except synchronized channel operations)

### Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: Scales linearly with number of workers
- **Latency**: Low latency due to concurrent processing
- **Memory**: Constant memory usage with buffered channels
- **CPU**: Efficient CPU utilization across multiple cores

## Data Flow

1. **Input**: Producer generates DataRecord structs
2. **Validation**: Checks value ranges and required fields
3. **Transformation**: Calculates anomaly scores and enriches data
4. **Output**: 
   - Valid processed records → `processed_data.jsonl`
   - Invalid/failed records → `failed_data.jsonl`
5. **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics collection

## Key Design Decisions

### Why Buffered Channels?

Buffered channels (size 100) prevent goroutine blocking when:
- Producer generates records faster than validators consume
- Validators validate faster than transformers transform
- Allows for bursts of activity without backpressure

### Why Fan-out Pattern?

The fan-out pattern ensures that:
- Loader, ErrorHandler, and MetricsCollector all receive ALL records
- No race conditions between consumers
- Clean separation of concerns

### Why No External Dependencies?

The project uses only Go standard library to:
- Demonstrate Go's powerful built-in concurrency support
- Minimize deployment complexity
- Ensure long-term maintainability
- Provide educational value for learning Go

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test individual pipeline components in isolation
- Verify correct behavior for valid and invalid inputs
- Use controlled test data

### Integration Tests
- Test the complete pipeline end-to-end
- Verify correct file output
- Validate metrics accuracy

### Benchmark Tests
- Measure throughput of individual stages
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Compare different worker configurations

## Monitoring and Observability

The MetricsCollector provides:
- Total records processed
- Total records with errors
- Count of anomalies detected
- Sum of all values processed

In a production system, these metrics would be exported to:
- Prometheus for time-series metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for log aggregation

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for production use:

1. **Configuration Management**: YAML/JSON config files
2. **External Data Sources**: Kafka, RabbitMQ, databases
3. **Distributed Tracing**: OpenTelemetry integration
4. **Health Checks**: HTTP endpoints for monitoring
5. **Graceful Shutdown**: Signal handling for clean termination
6. **Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for transient errors
7. **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures
8. **Rate Limiting**: Control throughput based on downstream capacity
